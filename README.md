DATA SCIENCE SUMMARY

Linear Regression
Predicts a number (like how tall you'll be based on your parents' height). Use it for house prices, stock values. Libraries: Scikit-learn. Buzzwords: correlation, coefficient.

Logistic Regression
Decides between two things (like if you'll pass or fail a test). Use it for spam detection, cancer diagnosis. Libraries: Scikit-learn, Statsmodels. Buzzwords: odds, probability, classification.

Decision Trees
Makes choices like a flowchart. Use it for which movie to watch, which fruit is it. Libraries: Scikit-learn. Buzzwords: split, node, entropy.

Random Forest
Lots of decision trees voting together. Use it for predicting customer churn, fraud detection. Libraries: Scikit-learn. Buzzwords: ensemble, bagging.
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Finds the best line to separate things (like cats and dogs). Use it for image classification, text categorization. Libraries: Scikit-learn. Buzzwords: kernel, hyperplane.

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Looks at the closest neighbors to decide what something is (like who you're friends with based on your classmates). Use it for recommendation systems, image recognition. Libraries: Scikit-learn. Buzzwords: distance, similarity.

Naive Bayes
Makes guesses based on what's most likely (like guessing what weather it is based on if it's cloudy). Use it for spam filtering, text classification. Libraries: Scikit-learn. Buzzwords: probability, independence.

Clustering
Groups similar things together (like sorting toys into boxes). Use it for customer segmentation, image compression. Libraries: Scikit-learn. Buzzwords: centroid, distance.

Neural Networks
Brain-like computer that learns from examples (like learning to ride a bike). Use it for image recognition, natural language processing. Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch. Buzzwords: neuron, activation function, deep learning.

Reinforcement Learning
Learning by trial and error (like a dog learning tricks). Use it for game playing, robotics. Libraries: TensorFlow, PyTorch. Buzzwords: reward, agent, environment.
